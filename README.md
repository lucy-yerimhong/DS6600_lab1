##### The use of a license and reasons
I chose the GPL-3.0 license for this project because (1) it permits other users to use the code in this repository for both commercial and noncommercial uses with full legal right to distribute, copy and/or modify it, and (2) it has a strong copyleft requirement, meaning that any larger works incorporating this code must be distributed under the same license. 

While many open source license(e.g., MIT, Apache, BSD) meet the first condition by allowing commercial and non-commercial use, distribution, mand modification, they do not have strong copyleft (second condition), which GPL v3 has. Without choosing GPL v.3, my code could have been incorporated into proprietary software or redistributed under a more restrictive license, which conflicts with my objective to keep it open and freely available.
